{
  "executive_summary": "Production increased by 12% mainly due to improved cycle time and reduced idle hours. Excavator utilization remained stable with slight upward trend across pits.",
  "ai_recommendations": "AI recommends reallocating 2 trucks from Pit C to Pit A due to significant road friction spike detected in C. Suggest increasing night shift allocation to stabilize production curve.",
  "operational_overview": "Most fleets operating within normal thresholds. No major deviations except slight fuel consumption increase on Dump Truck Group 3.",
  "cost_analysis": "Overall operational cost decreased by 4.7%. Fuel efficiency improvements contributed 2.1% savings. Maintenance cost normal with minor anomalies."
